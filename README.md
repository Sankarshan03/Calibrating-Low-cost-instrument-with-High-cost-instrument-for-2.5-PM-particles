# Calibrating-Low-cost-instrument-with-High-cost-instrument-for-2.5-PM-particles
Objective of this project was to find the correlation factor between low-cost and high-cost instrument by using regression analysis. Used Python as a platform for coding and used libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib for data formation and applying numerical analysis method.
